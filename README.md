In this project we present a novel solution for skin disease diagnosis. We will be able to classify them and provide efficient diagnosis in record times â€“ with a simple picture, patient can quickly identify their pathology by using Machine Learning and get quick instructions to tackle their illness, giving dermatologist more time to focus on finding the cure of the disease for the patient rather than diagnosing what disease patient is undergoing. This approach eliminates human bias, error and gives a speed increase in diagnosis time, on top of that it will democratize skin care, where everyone with a camera can have an accurate diagnosis.
